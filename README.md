# play-frontend-govuk

play-frontend-govuk was Scala Twirl implementation of the 
[govuk-frontend](https://github.com/alphagov/govuk-frontend/) components library as 
  documented in the [GOV.UK Design System](https://design-system.service.gov.uk/components/). 

It is now deprecated. Please use [play-frontend-hmrc](https://github.com/hmrc/play-frontend-hmrc) instead, which now
includes all functionality from this deprecated library.
